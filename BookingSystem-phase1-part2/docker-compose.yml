# ZAP Report – Round 2 (Phase 1, Part 2)

## 1. General Information
- **Application:** Booking System – Phase 1 – Part 2 (Updated Version)
- **Testers:** Roshani Pathak and Sushil poudel
- **Date:** 02.12.2025
- **Tool Used:** OWASP ZAP 2.16.1
- **Testing Type:** Automated security scan
- **Environment:** Windows 11, Docker Desktop, Opera Browser

## 2. Scope of the Scan
This Round 2 scan checks whether the issues found in Round 1 have been fixed and identifies any new risks.

**Pages scanned:**
- `/register`

Exclusions:
- Login, booking, admin functionality (not implemented in Phase 1)

## 3. Summary of Results (Round 2)
ZAP Round 2 produced two alerts:

1. **Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens** – Medium  
2. **User-Agent Fuzzing** – Informational  

**Important:**  
Missing security headers from Round 1 (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) **did NOT appear** in Round 2. This means they are now considered **fixed**.

## 4. Detailed Findings (Round 2)

### Finding ZR2-01 – Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens
- **Severity:** Medium  
- **Status vs Round 1:** New  
- **Description:**  
  ZAP detected that the registration form does not include anti-CSRF tokens.  
  Without CSRF tokens, attackers could trick authenticated users into unknowingly submitting requests.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Implement CSRF protection using secure tokens in all HTML forms.

### Finding ZR2-02 – User-Agent Fuzzing Differences
- **Severity:** Info  
- **Status vs Round 1:** New  
- **Description:**  
  ZAP tested multiple User-Agent headers (e.g., mobile browser, bots, crawlers) and received varied responses.  
  This is informational and does not indicate a direct vulnerability.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Standardize User-Agent handling if needed and monitor logs for unusual request patterns.

## 5. Comparison to Round 1
| Issue from Round 1 | Round 1 Status | Round 2 Status |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Missing Security Headers | Present | **Fixed** |
| Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens | Not reported | **New** |
| User-Agent Fuzzing | Not reported | **New** |

## 6. Conclusion
The updated application fixed the missing header issues detected in Round 1.  
However, ZAP found two new alerts in Round 2:

- Missing CSRF protection  
- User-Agent response inconsistencies  

These should be considered in future development phases.
